# BananaBot
A discord bot I created for my friend's server using discord.js

The main thing BananaBot is used for is a custom text-based game called "The Evolution Project". It is connected to a MongoDB and stores each user's data. Here's the basics of the game:

Each user starts at stage 1, you roll a d20 and any value 15 or above allows you to evolve by 1 stage. If you roll between 2-14, then you are stagnant and nothing happens. If you
roll a 1 then you devolve 1 stage. You also receive money everyday that can be gambled or used to purchae helpful items in the shop.
